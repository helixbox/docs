# Sky Savings USDS

## What is Sky Saving Rate, and how does it work?

The Sky Savings Rate (SSR) is an automated token-accumulation mechanism of the decentralised Sky Protocol that takes into account the effect of accumulated USDS compounded in real time. In other words, the USDS you supply to the Sky Savings Rate module enables you to receive sUSDS. The SSR is variable, determined not by market factors but by Sky ecosystem governance through a process of decentralised onchain voting.

When you supply USDS to the Sky Savings Rate module, you access the SSR and may receive sUSDS tokens in return. These sUSDS tokens serve as a digital record of your USDS interaction with the SSR module and any value accrued to your position.

The decentralised Sky Protocol dynamically adds USDS tokens to the pool every few seconds, in accordance with the Sky Savings Rate. As those tokens auto-accumulate in the pool over time, the value of the sUSDS you hold may gradually increase.

So, when you choose to redeem your sUSDS for USDSâ€”which you can do anytimeâ€”the total USDS you will receive will equal the amount you originally supplied, plus any additional USDS accumulated. With the Sky Protocol, you're always in full control of your supplied funds, as this feature is non-custodial.

## Does it cost anything to access the Sky Savings Rate?

Accessing the Sky Savings Rate via the Sky Protocol is free. However, any time you supply or withdraw assets to/from the Sky Savings Rate module, you will incur a transaction feeâ€” called a gas feeâ€”for using the Ethereum blockchain network. That fee is not controlled, imposed or received by Sky.money or the Sky Protocol.

## What is USDS?

USDS is the stablecoin of the decentralised Sky Protocol. It can be used in several ways, including to participate in the Sky Savings Rate and get Sky Token Rewards without giving up control. It is the upgraded version of DAI.

## What is sUSDS?

sUSDS is a savings token for eligible users. When you supply USDS to the Sky Savings Rate module, you access the Sky Savings Rate and may receive sUSDS tokens in return. These sUSDS tokens serve as a digital record of your USDS interaction with the SSR module and any value accrued to your position.

The decentralised Sky Protocol dynamically adds USDS tokens to the pool every few seconds, in accordance with the Sky Savings Rate. As those tokens auto-accumulate in the pool over time, the value of the sUSDS you hold may gradually increase.

So, when you choose to redeem your sUSDS for USDSâ€”which you can do anytimeâ€”the total USDS you will receive will equal the amount you originally supplied, plus any rewards accumulated. With the Sky Protocol, you can savings without giving up control of your supplied funds.

## What should I do after depositing?

Nothing! The system automates liquidity management. Just monitor the market and plan your exit strategy if needed.

## Can I withdraw anytime?

Yes, you can withdraw your fund anytime without restrictions.
