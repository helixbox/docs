# Export Smart Wallet



Helixbox uses a combination of technologies to provide a secure and user-friendly wallet experience:
- **Privy**: For secure wallet infrastructure and authentication
- **Safe\{Wallet\}**: For smart contract wallet implementation
- **EOA Wallet**: As the owner of your Smart Wallet
:::note[Disclaimer]
Helixbox does not store or manage any account information. Our wallet system is powered by Privy. 
For more details about the security architecture and implementation,
please visit [Privy's Security Documentation](https://docs.privy.io/guide/security/).
:::

## Wallet Architecture

Your Helixbox wallet combines:
1. **Base EOA Wallet** (Owner)  
   Controls the Smart Wallet
2. **Smart Wallet** (Safe\{Wallet\})  
   Manages assets and transactions



:::tip[backup or recovery]
No backup or recovery is needed as your wallet is secured by your EOA wallet or credentials through Privy.
