## Guide  

Helixbox utilizes **Bridge** technology to facilitate cross-chain transfers. It integrates multiple high-quality cross-chain protocols at the underlying layer and combines **Smart Account** technology at the upper layer to enhance the user experience.  

### **Cross-Chain Transfer Steps**  

1. **Select Source Chain and Token**  
   Choose the **source chain** and **token** you wish to transfer.  

2. **Select Destination Chain**  
   Specify the **destination chain** where you want to receive the assets.  

3. **Enter Transfer Amount**  
   Input the **amount** of tokens to be transferred.  

4. **Confirm and Sign**  
   - Click the **Transfer** button to submit the transaction request.  
   - Sign the transaction with your wallet and wait for execution.  

5. **Check Transaction Status**  
   Once the transaction is completed, you can check the received assets on the **destination chain**.  

### **Custom Receiving Address**  
Users can **customize the receiving address**, allowing assets to be sent to a specified wallet instead of the connected wallet by default.  

### **Security and Transparency**  
- Although Helixbox leverages **third-party cross-chain protocols**, it conducts **regular audits** and **monitors the transaction execution process** to ensure security.  
- A **clear transaction history** is provided, allowing users to track their transfers at any time.  

By following these steps, users can efficiently complete cross-chain transfers while ensuring security and transparency.
